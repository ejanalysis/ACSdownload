#' Pick a year-specific table from among lookup.acs2022, etc.
#' @description
#'   Pick a year-specific lookup table of information on American Community Survey (ACS) tables, from the Census Bureau,
#'   namely which sequence files on the FTP site contain which tables and which variables.
#' @param end.year Character, optional, like "2020", which specifies the 2016-2020 dataset.
#'   Defines which 5-year summary file to use, based on end-year.
#'   Note: Function stops with error if given end.year is not yet added to this package or is too old.
#' @return returns a data.frame
#' @seealso [get.table.info()] and [get.field.info()]. \cr
#'   Also see [acs::acs.lookup()] which does something similar but is more flexible & robust.
#'   Also see [download.lookup.acs()] to download the file from the Census FTP site.
#'   Also see [lookup.acs] [lookup.acs2022] and similar data for other years.
#'   Also see [get.acs()], [get.lookup.file.name()], [get.url.prefix.lookup.table()]
#'   [tidycensus::load_variables()]
#' @examples
#'  names(lookup.acs2022)
#'  names(lookup.acs)

#' @export
