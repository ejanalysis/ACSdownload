Why NA values in WY bg for C17?  sumlevel==150 (bg)
B25034 was NA for 945 tracts - why?
B16002 was NA for all tracts - why?
560019627001 for example

Show progress bars on download.file for geo and for data, as options

maybe add param to let you try to file.remove() the zip files in get.geo and download... functions and get.acs(),
and same for .txt files after they are read and assembled and saved - Make sure none were missing/failed.

[In analyze.stuff pkg, make zero, neg, and min.nonzero cols outputs of na.check.R for char cols be 0, 0, and first one (like max finds last)]
