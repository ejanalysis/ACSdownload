<dl><dt id="arg-tables">tables<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#arg-tables"></a></dt>
<dd><p>Character vector, optional. Defines tables to obtain, such as 'B01001' (the default).
NOTE: If the user specifies a table called 'ejscreen' then a set of tables used by that tool are included.
Those tables in EJScreen 2.0 are
c("B01001", "B03002", "B15002", 'C16002', "C17002", "B25034", 'B23025')</p></dd>


<dt id="arg-mystates">mystates<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#arg-mystates"></a></dt>
<dd><p>Character vector, optional, 'all' by default which means all available states
plus DC and PR but not VI etc. Defines which States to include in downloads of data tables.</p></dd>


<dt id="arg-end-year">end.year<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#arg-end-year"></a></dt>
<dd><p>Character, optional. Defines a valid ending year of a 5-year summary file.
Can be '2020' for example. Not all years are tested. Actually works if numeric like 2017, instead of character, too.</p></dd>


<dt id="arg-base-path">base.path<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#arg-base-path"></a></dt>
<dd><p>Character, optional, getwd() by default. Defines a base folder to start from, in case
data.path and/or output.path are not specified, in which case a subfolder under base.path,
called acsdata or acsoutput respectively, will be created and used for downloads or outputs of the function.</p></dd>


<dt id="arg-data-path">data.path<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#arg-data-path"></a></dt>
<dd><p>Character, optional, file.path(base.path, 'acsdata') by default.
Defines folder (created if does not exist) where downloaded files will be stored.</p></dd>


<dt id="arg-output-path">output.path<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#arg-output-path"></a></dt>
<dd><p>Character, optional, file.path(base.path, 'acsoutput') by default.
Defines folder (created if does not exist) where output files (results of this function) will be stored.</p></dd>


<dt id="arg-sumlevel">sumlevel<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#arg-sumlevel"></a></dt>
<dd><p>Default is "both" (case insensitive) in which case tracts and block groups are returned.
Also c('tract', 'bg') or c(140,150) and similar patterns work.
If "tract" or 140 or some other match, but not block groups, is specified (insensitive to case, tract can be plural or part of a word, etc.),
just tracts are returned.
If "bg" or 150 or "blockgroups" or "block groups" or some other match (insensitive to case, singular or plural or part of a word)
but no match on tracts is specified, just block groups are returned.
Non-matching elements are ignored (e.g., sumlevel=c('bg', 'tracs', 'block') will return block groups
but neither tracts (because of the typo) nor blocks (not available in ACS), with no warning –
No warning is given if sumlevel is set to a list of elements where some are not recognized as matches to bg or tract,
as long as one or more match bg, tracts, or both (or variants as already noted).</p></dd>


<dt id="arg-vars">vars<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#arg-vars"></a></dt>
<dd><p>Optional, default is 'all' (in which case all variables from each table will be returned unless otherwise specified – see below).
This parameter specifies whether to pause and ask the user about which variables are needed in an interactive session in R.
This gives the user a chance to prepare the file "variables needed.csv" (or just ensure it is ready),
or to edit and save "variables needed.csv" within a window in the default editor used by R (the user is asked which of these is preferred).
If vars is 'ask', the function just looks in <code>data.folder</code> for a file called "variables needed.csv" that, if used,
must specify which variables to keep from each table.
The format of that file should be the same as is found in the file "variables needed template.csv" created by this function –
keeping the letter "Y" in the column named "keep" indicates the given variable is needed.
A blank or "N" or other non-Y specifies the variable should be dropped and not returned by get.acs().
If the "variables needed.csv" file is not found, however, this function looks for and uses the file called "variables needed template.csv"
which is written by this function and specifies all of the variables from each table, so all variables will be retained and returned by get.acs().</p></dd>


<dt id="arg-varsfile">varsfile<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#arg-varsfile"></a></dt>
<dd><p>See help for <code><a href="set.needed.html">set.needed()</a></code> for details. Optional name of file that can be used to specify which variables are needed from specified tables.
If varsfile is specified, parameter vars is ignored, and the function just looks in folder for file called filename, e.g., "variables needed.csv"
that should specify which variables to keep from each table.</p></dd>


<dt id="arg-new-geo">new.geo<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#arg-new-geo"></a></dt>
<dd><p>Default is TRUE. If FALSE, just uses existing downloaded geo file if possible. If TRUE, forced to download geo file even if already done previously.</p></dd>


<dt id="arg-write-files">write.files<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#arg-write-files"></a></dt>
<dd><p>Default is FALSE, but if TRUE then data-related csv files are saved locally – Saves longnames, full fieldnames as csv file, in working directory.</p></dd>


<dt id="arg-save-files">save.files<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#arg-save-files"></a></dt>
<dd><p>Default is FALSE, but if TRUE then various intermediate image files are saved as .RData files locally in working directory.</p></dd>


<dt id="arg-write-acspkg">write.acspkg<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#arg-write-acspkg"></a></dt>
<dd><p>Default is FALSE. If TRUE, saves csv file of tracts and file of block groups, for each of the <code>tables</code>,
in a format that the Census Bureau American Fact Finder provides as downloadable tables. That format can be easily read in by the very useful <span class="pkg">acs</span> package.</p></dd>


<dt id="arg-testing">testing<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#arg-testing"></a></dt>
<dd><p>Default is FALSE, but if TRUE more information is shown on progress, using cat() and while downloading, and more files (csv) are saved in working directory. But see silent parameter.</p></dd>


<dt id="arg-noeditonmac">noEditOnMac<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#arg-noeditonmac"></a></dt>
<dd><p>FALSE by default. If TRUE, do not pause to allow edit() to define which variables needed from each table,
when on Mac OSX, even if vars=TRUE. Allows you to avoid problem in RStudio if X11 not installed.</p></dd>


<dt id="arg-silent">silent<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#arg-silent"></a></dt>
<dd><p>Optional logical, default is FALSE. Should progress updates be shown (sent to standard out, like the screen).</p></dd>


<dt id="arg-save-log">save.log<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#arg-save-log"></a></dt>
<dd><p>Optional logical, default is TRUE. Should log file be saved in output.path folder</p></dd>


<dt id="arg-filename-log">filename.log<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#arg-filename-log"></a></dt>
<dd><p>Optional name (without extension) for a log file, which gets date and time and .txt extension appended to it. Default is "log"</p></dd>

    <p>By default, returns a list of ACS data tables and information about them, with these elements in the list: <br>
bg, tracts, headers, and info. The headers and info elements are data.frames providing metadata such as short and long field names.
The same column names are found in x$info and x$headers, but headers has more rows. The info table just provides information about each
data variable in the estimates tables. The headers table provides similar information but made to match the bg or tract format,
so the headers table has as many rows as bg or tracts has columns – enough for the estimates and MOE fields, and the basic fields such as FIPS.
The info data.frame can look like this, for example: <br></p><div class="sourceCode"><pre><code>
  'data.frame':	xxxx obs. of  9 variables:
 $ table.ID       : chr  "B01001" "B01001" "B01001" "B01001" ...

<p>The United States Census Bureau provides detailed demographic data by US Census tract and block group
in the American Community Survey (ACS) 5-year summary file via their FTP site. For those interested in block group or tract data,
Census Bureau tools tend to focus on obtaining data one state at a time rather than for the entire US at once.
This function lets a user specify (tables and) variables needed. This will look up what sequence files
contain those tables. Using a table of variables for those selected tables, a user can specify variables
or tables to drop by putting x or anything other than "Y" in the column specifying needed variables. <br><br>
