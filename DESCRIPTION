Description: This R package helps you download and parse raw data from the 
  Census Bureau American Community Survey 5-year Summary Files, 
  providing demographic data at the block and tract levels of resolution.
  You can obtain data from the entire USA all at once using this package, for one or more tables.
  Typically the Census Bureau makes it easy to obtain data from one state at a time,
  not every block group in the US. There are roughly 220,000 block groups in the US,
  and around 74,000 tracts. Other data sources that may be relevant include Census geodatabases at  
  http://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/tiger-data.html and data at http://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/gazetteer.html
