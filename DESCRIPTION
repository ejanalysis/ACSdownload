Title: Obtain American Community Survey Summary File Data Tables from Census
    Bureau FTP Site (for EJ analysis, etc.)
Description: This R package helps you download and parse raw data from the
    Census Bureau American Community Survey 5-year Summary Files, providing
    demographic data at the block and tract levels of resolution. You can obtain
    data from the entire USA all at once using this package, for one or more
    tables. Typically the Census Bureau makes it easy to obtain data from one
    state at a time, not every block group in the US. There are roughly 220,000
    block groups in the US, and around 74,000 tracts.
    Some options for obtaining Census ACS data are listed here: 
    http://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/data.html 
    Other data sources that may be relevant include Census geodatabases 
    at http://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/tiger-data.html and data at 
    http://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/gazetteer.html
